=======

This repository is my personal Ansible repository for configuring my home
servers.


Roles
-----

- *baseline*: a usable baseline for servers. Sets up networking, ntp, sshd,
  sudo, and user accounts. Also installs some nice-to-have utilities: zsh,
  grml's zsh configuration, tmux, htop, and vim. Sets up a basic configuration
  for tmux and vim.
